Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to coding adventures

I'll be using this blog as a way to document and share my adventures with all of you (_Hopefully it'll be more than just me...!_). As this is my first post I won't go too much into detail, since I want this to be a fun space for me to share and not something that is forced. I will be going through setting up a blog with Jekyll and heopfully be able to demystify the process.

I expect as the site grows I will be making tweaks and changes to it. For now it was more important to just slap on a theme and call it a day... Ok I did a bit more than that I also wrote a small introduction post. That counts for something right?!

Look forward to bringing content and hopefully being able to anwser questions along the way!

Goodbye for now
