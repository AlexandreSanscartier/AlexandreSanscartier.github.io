Hey! Welcome to my coding adventures. Grab a coffee(☕) and a seat around the fire(🔥) and join me as I bring you on my adventures.
Like all aventures there will be a bunch of emotions sadness, frustration, lots of humour. Best of all is learning we'll do along the way.

## ⚔️ Current Adventure ⚔️

Currently I'm working through the [Foundations of Game Engine Development](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0985811749/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1337040d-20&camp=15121&creative=330641&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0985811749&linkId=a011b1ff707e947a2cb63d87a3777723) and writing my own library for performing [vector & matrix math](https://github.com/AlexandreSanscartier/special-spoon).
